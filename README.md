# Simple Ray Tracer in Python

This is a simple ray tracer written in Python. It is a fork of Cyrille Rossant's [gist](https://gist.github.com/rossant/6046463).

I provide a few more information in my [Wiki](https://github.com/jsilvcast/simpleraytracing/wiki).

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python raytracing.py
```
